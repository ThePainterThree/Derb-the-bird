# Description

    Meet Derb, the bird who is about to embark on an exciting journey through the city. His wings are ready to carry him through the skyline. How about you? 
    Along his way, he must dodge from objects thrown in the sky. Stay sharp and be quick with your reactions to avoid getting hit by obstacles! You have 3 lives in total to help Derb complete his journey.
